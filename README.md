# Waste_Management_Project

## Dataset Summary

This dataset is a structured, multivariate, time-series dataset containing sensor readings for waste monitoring. It records various properties of waste materials collected from multiple sensors, categorized into three waste types: `recyclable`, `non_recyclable`, and `organic`.

### Key Features:
1. **Categorical Variables**:
   - `sensor_id`: Unique identifier for each sensor.
   - `waste_type`: Type of waste (`recyclable`, `non_recyclable`, `organic`).

2. **Continuous Variables**:
   - `inductive_property`: Measures inductive characteristics of waste.
   - `capacitive_property`: Reflects capacitive properties.
   - `moisture_property`: Indicates moisture content.
   - `infrared_property`: Represents infrared properties.

3. **Time-Series Component**:
   - `timestamp`: Records the date and time of each sensor reading.

This dataset is suitable for tasks such as exploratory data analysis, waste classification, and sensor performance monitoring.
